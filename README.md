# ChainGraph: Real-Time GraphQL Toolkit for EOSIO/Antelope

ChainGraph provides performant GraphQL APIs for blockchain applications featuring state of art subscriptions, advanced filtering, sorting, pagination and aggregations across multiple blockchains.

## Features

- **Real-Time GraphQL Subscriptions** ‚Äì Subscribe to blockchain state and transactions/instructions/actions
- **Advanced Data Operations** ‚Äì Powerful search, filtering, sorting and aggregation capabilities
- **Blockchain RPC Facade** ‚Äì Push through guarantees for reliable data access
- **Multi-Blockchain Support** ‚Äì Read data from multiple contracts, tables and blockchains on a single request
- **Microfork Handling** ‚Äì Subscribe to state on the clients not to deltas
- **Developer Tools** ‚Äì CLI with high quality application starters to speed up go-to-market

## Architecture

<img src="./assets/chaingraph-diagram.svg" alt="ChainGraph Architecture" />

Hasura is a high-performance GraphQL engine that exposes the GraphQL schema and optimizes subscriptions. It includes an API authentication service and real-time data indexing services, which are currently written in NodeJS.

## Technology

ChainGraph API nodes are light and index whitelisted data tables and actions. The project is split into separate micro-services to make it easier to scale:

- **chaingraph-engine**: GraphQL engine and database migrations using Hasura
- **chaingraph-auth**: Authentication service for api-key validations
- **chaingraph-indexer**: Multi-threaded NodeJS service for real-time data deserialization and indexing
- **chaingraph-explorer**: GraphiQL interface for developers

## Data Whitelisting

ChainGraph is currently using a contract mapping protocol that allows developers to define how the data is indexed. Through these mappings ChainGraph can index the data in a way that is good for introspection of the blockchain heuristics. We will iterate on the mapping protocol to achieve fully typed schemas in the future.

## Development Setup

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+

```bash
pnpm backend    # Start backend services
pnpm dev        # Dev server
pnpm build      # Production build
pnpm test       # Run tests
```
